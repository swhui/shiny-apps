# A Repertoire of Shiny Applications

This project contains a collection of shiny web applications, which I have used while teaching and created for fun. Below is a list and description of each shiny web application.

## [The Magic of CLT](https://swhui.shinyapps.io/CLT-Magic/)

The Central Limit Theorem states that under sufficient conditions, when we sum or take the mean of a sequence of independent random variables, their (normalized) sum approaches a normal distribution. Although a powerful and useful theorem, CLT is not the most intuitive. This application demonstrates CLT in action!

## [Euclidean Algorithm Calculator](https://swhui.shinyapps.io/euclidean-alg/)

The Euclidean Algorithm is a method to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) between two integers. The GCD is the largest number that divides both integers without a remainder.

## [Plot a Function](https://swhui.shinyapps.io/plotting_functions/)

This is a simple application that plots functions between -10,000 to 10,000.
