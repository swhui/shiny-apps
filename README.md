# A Repertoire of Shiny Applications

This project contains a collection of shiny web applications, which I have used while teaching and created for fun. Below is a list and description of each shiny web application

## [The Magic of CLT](https://swhui.shinyapps.io/CLT-Magic/)

The Central Limit Theorem states that under sufficient conditions, when we sum or take the mean of a sequence of independent random variables, their (normalized) sum approaches a normal distribution. Although a powerful and useful theorem, CLT is not the most intuitive. This application demonstrates CLT in action!
